# Image-Recognition
This repository contains the hands-on projects and notebooks I developed during a 5-day Image Recognition Bootcamp conducted by DevTown. The bootcamp provided a practical, step-by-step journey through deep learning concepts, from basic image classification to transfer learning with pre-trained models.

Over five days, I explored the fundamentals of image recognition, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), data preprocessing, augmentation, evaluation metrics, and model deployment.
I worked on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Cats vs. Dogs datasets, achieving high accuracy in digit, object, and binary image classification tasks.
