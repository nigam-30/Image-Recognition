# Image-Recognition
This repository contains the hands-on projects and notebooks I developed during a 5-day Image Recognition Bootcamp conducted by DevTown. The bootcamp provided a practical, step-by-step journey through deep learning concepts, from basic image classification to transfer learning with pre-trained models.
